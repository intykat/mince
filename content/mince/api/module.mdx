# Module Lifecycle API

These are optional methods that can be defined in your Mince-managed modules to hook into the framework's initialization sequence.

---

### `:Setup()`
A method that, if defined on a module, is called after all modules have been loaded and are accessible via `Mince:Get()`. This is the primary method for all initialization logic, especially for code that depends on other modules.

---

### `:GameStart()`
A method that, if defined on a module, is called after the `:Setup()` method has been successfully executed for **all** modules. This is useful for post-initialization logic that needs to run with the guarantee that every module in the framework has completed its setup phase.
