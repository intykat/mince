# State API

Mince States are an advanced, table-like data structure for synchronizing complex data from the server to clients. They are a removable addon.

---

### `Mince:GetState(...)`
Retrieves or creates a state object. A state must be created on the server before a client can access it.

- **Server Signature**: `(NameOrInstance, [Group], [InitialData])`
  - `NameOrInstance` (string | Instance): Unique identifier or instance to bind to.
  - `Group` (string, optional): A group identifier for the state.
  - `InitialData` (table, optional): The initial data for the state.

- **Client Signature**: `(NameOrInstance, [Group])`

---

### `Mince:WaitForState(...)` (Client-only)
Yields the current script until the specified state is available.

- **Signature**: `(NameOrInstance, [Group])`

---

## State Object API

### `:Observe(Key, Callback)`
Watches for changes to a specific key within the state.
- **Callback Signature**: `function(newValue, oldValue)`

### `.Changed`
A `BindableEvent`-like object that fires when any value in the state changes.
- **Callback Signature**: `function(key, newValue, oldValue)`

### `:GetRaw()`
Returns a deep copy of the state's data as a raw Lua table.

### Array Methods
For manipulating array-like data within a state.
- `:ArrayInsert(index, value)`
- `:ArrayRemove(index)`
- `:ArrayUnpack()`
- `:ArrayMove(from, to, amount)`
- `:ArrayMaxn()`
- `:ArrayFind(value)`
- `:ArrayConcat(otherTable)`
- `:ArrayClear()`

---

## Root State API
These methods are only available on the top-level state object returned by `GetState`, not on sub-tables.

### `:Destroy()`
Destroys the state. If called on the server, it is destroyed for all clients.

### `:SetAudience({Player})` (Server-only)
Restricts state replication to a specific list of players. Call with `nil` to replicate to all.

### `:Detach()` (Client-only)
Stops the client from receiving server updates. Local changes will still fire local events. Used for client-side prediction.

### `:Reattach()` (Client-only)
Resumes receiving updates from the server. Does not automatically sync the state upon reattachment.

### `:ForceUpdate(Player, Key)` (Server-only)
Forces a specific client to synchronize a specific key with the server's current value, even if the client is detached.
