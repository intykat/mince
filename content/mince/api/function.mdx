# Function API

Mince Functions provide a declarative API for request/response style communication, built on `RemoteFunction`. They are a removable addon.

---

### `Mince:GetFunction(NameOrInstance)`
Retrieves or creates a networking function. A function must be created on the server before it can be accessed by a client.

- **Arguments**:
  - `NameOrInstance` (string | Instance): The unique name of the function or a replicated `Instance` to attach it to.

---

## Function Object API

`Mince:GetFunction` returns a Function object with the following API:

### `:Invoke(...)`
Calls the remote function and yields the current script until a response is returned from the peer.

- **Warning**: It is strongly discouraged to invoke the client from the server, as the server thread can be permanently stuck if the client never responds.

### `.OnInvoke`
A callback used to handle an incoming invocation and return a result.

- **Signature**: `function(...)`
- **On the Server**: The first argument passed to the callback will be the `Player` object of the invoking client.
- **Return Value**: The value(s) returned from this function will be sent back to the caller of `:Invoke`.
