# Component API

This document details the API for creating and managing Mince Components. They are a removable addon.

---

### `Mince.Component(Table)`
Defines a new component type. This function returns a singleton object that is used to manage all component objects of this type.

- **Options Table**:
  - `Tag` (string, required): The `CollectionService` tag that this component is associated with.
  - `CreationParents` (array, optional): A list of `Instance`s where the framework will look for tagged objects. If not provided, it will search the entire game.

---

## Component Lifecycle Methods

These methods are defined on the table returned by `Mince.Component`.

### `:Construct()`
Called on a component object when a tagged `Instance` is found within the `CreationParents`. This is where you should place all setup logic for the component object.

### `:Removing()`
Called on a component object when its associated `Instance` is destroyed, the tag is removed, or it is parented outside of its `CreationParents`. This is where you should place all cleanup logic.

---

## Component Object Properties

Within the lifecycle methods, `self` refers to the component object, which has the following properties:

- `self.Instance`: A direct reference to the `Instance` the component object is attached to.
- `self.AttributeName`: Any attributes found on the `Instance` are automatically added as properties to the component object.

---

## Component Singleton Methods

These methods are called on the singleton object returned by `Mince.Component`.

### `:GetAll()`
Returns an array containing all active component objects of this type.

### `:FromInstance(Instance)`
Returns the specific component object that is attached to the given `Instance`. Returns `nil` if no component object is found.
