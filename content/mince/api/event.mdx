# Event API

Mince Events provide a declarative API for one-way, real-time communication between the client and server, built on top of `RemoteEvent` and `UnreliableRemoteEvent`. They are a removable addon.

---

### `Mince:GetEvent(NameOrInstance, [IsUnreliable])`
Retrieves or creates a networking event. An event must be created on the server before it can be accessed by a client.

- **Arguments**:
  - `NameOrInstance` (string | Instance): The unique name of the event or a replicated `Instance` to attach it to.
  - `IsUnreliable` (boolean, optional): If `true`, the event will use an `UnreliableRemoteEvent`. Defaults to `false`.

---

## Event Object API

`Mince:GetEvent` returns an Event object with the following API:

### `.Event`
A `BindableEvent`-like object. Connect a function to this to listen for incoming data from the remote peer.
- **Server Listener Signature**: `function(Player, ...)`
- **Client Listener Signature**: `function(...)`

### `:Fire(...)`
Fires the event to the remote peer.
- **On the Client**: Sends the event and arguments to the server.
- **On the Server**: The first argument must be the destination `Player` object, followed by any other arguments.

### `:FireAll(...)` (Server-only)
Fires the event to all connected clients.

### `:Extend(SubEventName)`
Creates and returns a new, independent "sub-event" object that uses the same underlying `RemoteEvent`. This is useful for organizing related functionality without creating more remotes.
- **Arguments**:
  - `SubEventName` (string): The name of the sub-event.
