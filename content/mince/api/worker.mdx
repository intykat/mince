# Mince.Worker

Creates a proxy for a pool of stateless job processors that run in parallel.

```lua
local MyWorker = Mince.Worker(ModuleScript)
```

## Worker Proxy

The object returned by `Mince.Worker()`. You interact with this single object to dispatch tasks to the entire pool.

### `Proxy:AwaitAll()`
Yields the current script until all tasks currently running in the worker pool have completed.

```lua
-- Fire off some tasks
task.defer(function() MyWorker:DoHeavyMath() end)
task.defer(function() MyWorker:DoOtherMath() end)

-- Wait for both to finish
MyWorker:AwaitAll()
print("All tasks are done!")
```

### `Proxy.Shared`
A `SharedTable` that is created once and shared across **all** actors in the pool. This is defined in the worker's source module. If not defined, this will be `nil`.

### Custom Methods
Any function defined in your worker's source module can be called on the proxy. The call is added to a queue and automatically distributed to the next available actor in the pool. The main thread will yield until the task is complete and a result is returned.

```lua
local Result = MyWorker:Compute("some_data")
print("Worker returned:", Result)
```
