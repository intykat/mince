# Getting Started

## Creating a new project from scratch
<Steps>
### Get the Mince Module

The Mince module can be found here.

### Create your architecture

Create folders that you want your code to run from. This is the recommended folder structure for mince projects:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="ReplicatedStorage" defaultOpen>

    <FileTree.Folder name="Runtime" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="Config" defaultOpen >
        <FileTree.Folder name="Shared" />
      </FileTree.Folder>

      <FileTree.Folder name="Source" />
    </FileTree.Folder>

    <FileTree.Folder name="Modules" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="Mince" />
    </FileTree.Folder>

  </FileTree.Folder>

  <FileTree.Folder name="ServerScriptService" defaultOpen>

    <FileTree.Folder name="Runtime" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="Config" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="Source" />
    </FileTree.Folder>

  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

The rest of this tutorial assumes this file structure.

### Bootstrap Mince

Mince was designed to be as lightweight as possible, as such you must tell Mince where to load your code from, and tell Mince to initiate the framework. 
This gives you control over the load order of modules and configs.

Bootstrap the Server:
```luau copy filename="Script (ServerScriptService/Runtime/MinceLoader)"
-- == || Mince Startup || == -- 
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Mince = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Modules.Mince) -- Or your path to Mince.

Mince:LoadConfig(ServerScriptService.Runtime.Config) -- Loads all the config in the config folder incl the shared. 
Mince:LoadConfig(ReplicatedStorage.Runtime.Config.Shared) -- Loads the shared config.
Mince:LoadModules(ReplicatedStorage.Runtime.Source) -- Loads all modules in the folder, this is your game's "code".


Mince:Start() -- Starts calling all setup and post methods.
```

Bootstrap the Client:
```luau copy filename="LocalScript (ReplicatedStorage/Runtime/MinceLoader)"
-- == || Mince Startup || == -- 
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Mince = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Modules.Mince) -- Or your path to Mince.

print("Waiting for server...")
Mince:WaitUntilSetup("Server") -- Wait until the server is running.
Mince:LoadConfig(ReplicatedStorage.Runtime.Config) -- Loads all modules in the folder as static configurations.
Mince:LoadModules(ReplicatedStorage.Runtime.Source) -- Loads all modules in the folder, this is your game's "code".

Mince:Start() -- Starts calling all setup and post methods.
```
