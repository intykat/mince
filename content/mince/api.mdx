# Mince API Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the Mince framework's API.

## Core Framework

These are the primary functions for managing modules and the framework lifecycle.

### `Mince:LoadModules(Instance)`
Recursively searches for and loads all `ModuleScript`s within a given `Instance`, integrating them into the Mince framework.

### `Mince:Get(string)`
Retrieves a loaded module by its name. This is the standard way to access other modules within the framework.

### `Mince:WaitUntilSetup(string)`
Yields the current thread until the Mince framework has completed its setup for the specified context.
- **Arguments**: `"Client"` or `"Server"`.

---

## Module Lifecycle Methods

These optional methods can be defined in your modules to hook into the framework's initialization sequence.

### `:Setup()`
Called on a module after all modules have been loaded. This is the primary method for initialization logic.

### `:GameStart()`
Called on a module after the `:Setup()` method has been executed for **all** modules.

---

## Components

Components attach logic to game objects using `CollectionService` tags.

### `Mince.Component(Table)`
Defines a new component. The returned object is a singleton used to manage all objects of that component type.
- **Options Table**:
  - `Tag` (string, required): The `CollectionService` tag to associate with.
  - `CreationParents` (array, optional): A list of `Instance`s to search for tagged objects.

### Component Lifecycle Methods

### `:Construct()`
Called on a component object when a tagged `Instance` is found. Use this for setup logic.

### `:Removing()`
Called on a component object when the `Instance` is destroyed or the tag is removed. Use this for cleanup.

### Component Object Properties
- `self.Instance`: A reference to the `Instance` the component object is attached to.
- `self.AttributeName`: Attributes on the `Instance` are directly accessible on the component object.

### Component Singleton Methods

### `:GetAll()`
Returns an array of all active component objects for that component type.

### `:FromInstance(Instance)`
Returns the specific component object attached to the given `Instance`.

## Networking

Mince provides declarative and robust APIs for client-server communication.

### Events
Built on `RemoteEvent` and `UnreliableRemoteEvent` for one-way communication.

#### `Mince:GetEvent(string, [boolean])`
Retrieves or creates a networking event.
- **Arguments**:
  - `EventName` (string): The unique name of the event. Can also be a replicated `Instance`.
  - `IsUnreliable` (boolean, optional): If `true`, uses an `UnreliableRemoteEvent`.

#### Event Object API
- `.Event`: A `BindableEvent`-like object. Connect to this to listen for data.
- `:Fire(...)`: Fires the event. On the server, the first argument must be the destination `Player`.
- `:FireAll(...)` (Server-only): Fires the event to all clients.
- `:Extend(string)`: Creates a "sub-event" that acts as its own independent event object, useful for organization.

### Functions
Built on `RemoteFunction` for request/response communication.

#### `Mince:GetFunction(string)`
Retrieves or creates a networking function.
- **Arguments**:
  - `FunctionName` (string): The unique name of the function. Can also be a replicated `Instance`.

#### Function Object API
- `:Invoke(...)`: Calls the remote function and yields until a response is returned.
- `.OnInvoke = function(...)`: The callback handler for an incoming invocation. Must return a value.

### States
Advanced, table-like data structures that synchronize from server to client.

#### `Mince:GetState(...)`
Retrieves or creates a state.
- **Server Signature**: `(NameOrInstance, [Group], [InitialData])`
- **Client Signature**: `(NameOrInstance, [Group])`

#### `Mince:WaitForState(...)` (Client-only)
Yields until a state is available.
- **Signature**: `(NameOrInstance, [Group])`

#### State Object API
- `.Changed:Connect(function(index, newValue, oldValue))`: Fires when any value in the state changes.
- `:Observe(string, function(newValue, oldValue))`: Watches for changes to a specific key.
- `:GetRaw()`: Returns a raw, deep copy of the state's data as a standard Lua table.
- **Array Methods**: `:ArrayInsert`, `:ArrayUnpack`, `:ArrayMove`, `:ArrayMaxn`, `:ArrayFind`, `:ArrayConcat`, `:ArrayRemove`, `:ArrayClear`.

#### Root State API
These methods are only available on the top-level state object returned by `GetState`.
- `:Destroy()`: Destroys the state.
- `:SetAudience({Player})` (Server-only): Restricts state replication to a specific list of players.
- `:Detach()` (Client-only): Stops the client from receiving server updates, for client-side prediction.
- `:Reattach()` (Client-only): Resumes receiving server updates.
- `:ForceUpdate(Player, string)` (Server-only): Forces a client to sync a specific key with the server's value.
