# Chop Insights

Chop Insights is a powerful tool that allows you to monitor your framework's networking and identify key areas to optimize in terms of framework performance.

It works by transparently inserting an addon into the Mince framework that wraps Mince-related functions with timers and monitors, collecting valuable performance data without requiring you to change your code.

Insights automatically collects statistics while you are play-testing in Studio. Once you stop the play session, the dashboard will appear, presenting the data from that session for you to analyze.
