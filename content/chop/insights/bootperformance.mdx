# Boot Performance

The Boot Performance analysis of Chop Insights helps you diagnose and optimize the initial startup time of the Mince framework. It provides a detailed breakdown of how long each part of your framework takes to load.

Insights collects statistics on three main areas during startup:
- **Mince Modules**: `require()` time and `:Setup()` time.
- **Configs**: `require()` time and memory usage.
- **Components**: `:Construct()` time and instance count.

## Interpreting Startup Times

A good benchmark to aim for is a total startup time of **under 8 seconds** (a combined 4 seconds on the client and 4 seconds on the server). If your overall startup time is longer than this, it's worth investigating the cause using the Insights dashboard.

A common and highly effective way to speed up loading is to defer non-essential work. If a module's `:Setup()` function needs to yield or perform a long-running task that isn't required for other modules to initialize, wrap its logic in `task.defer()` to move it out of the critical startup path.

## Analyzing Boot Components

### Modules
Insights tracks two phases for modules:
- **Require Time**: This should be as fast as possible. A module should ideally return its table of functions immediately, with minimal logic performed at the top level of the script.
- **Setup Time**: This is where the bulk of a module's initialization logic should be. Insights will show you which modules have the longest setup times, making them primary candidates for optimization.

### Configs
- **Require Time**: Configs should load almost instantly, as they should primarily contain static data.
- **Memory Usage**: Since config files are stored in memory, Insights will highlight the largest configs. This can help you identify if a config file has grown too large and should be refactored.

### Components
Insights tracks two key metrics for components at startup:
- **Construct Time**: The total time spent running the `:Construct()` method for all instances of a component.
- **Construct Count**: The number of instances of a component that were created during startup.

While component construction can sometimes take time if dependencies need to be loaded, you should aim to keep the `:Construct()` method as lean as possible.

## Interacting with the Dashboard

To help you quickly find the source of a performance issue, you can **right-click** on modules and configs listed in the Boot Performance view. This will open a context menu:
