# Introduction

**Chop** is a powerful Roblox Studio plugin that provides smart features like Intellisense and performance analytics specifically for the Mince framework. It is an intelligent tool that elevates the development experience, making Mince both powerful and easy to work in.

Chop has two main components that bring this functionality to life:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<img src="/img/Chop.png" alt="Chop Icon" width="32" height="32" />}
    title="Intellisense features"
    href="/chop/intellisense"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<img src="/img/analysis.png" alt="Chop Icon" width="32" height="32" />}
    title="Insights widget"
    href="/chop/insights"
  />
</Cards>
