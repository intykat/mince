# Code Snippets

Snippets provide a way for you to quickly adopt Mince coding patterns and accelerate your development. They are templates for common code structures that help ensure your code is consistent and boilerplate-free.

## Using Snippets

To use a snippet, simply type `Chop.` on a new line in the script editor. This will open a suggestion window with all the available Mince snippets.

A key feature of snippets is that if you select one that requires the Mince framework, Chop will automatically add the `require` statement for Mince at the top of your script if it doesn't already exist.

## Available Snippets

### `Chop.Setup`
This snippet creates the basic structure for a standard Mince module, including the `:Setup()` lifecycle method.

**Result:**
```lua
-- Mince import...

local Module = {}

function Module:Setup()

end

return Module
```

### `Chop.Component`
This snippet creates the boilerplate for a new Mince Component, including the `:Construct()` lifecycle method and a placeholder `Tag`.

**Result:**
```lua
-- Mince import...

local Component = Mince.Component {
	Tag = "TagName"
}

function Component:Construct()
	
end

return Component
```
